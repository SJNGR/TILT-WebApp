    <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Advancing Equality using AI Large Language Models</h4>
<p>In our modern life, encountering needlessly gendered terms can be confusing, demoralising, reduce empathy, and create between people divisive feelings of isolation or entitlement.</p>
  
  <p>The assumed-male defaults of the English language have long been a thorn in the side of the goal towards equality and mutual respect between the sexes, and the discriminations of the past have become roadblocks in our collective journey forward into a truly equal world.<br>
</p>
<p>Large Language Model (LLM) AI processing can help humanity achieve closure on the inadvertant infractions of past writers while keeping their messages intact, helping the new generation of readers to once more uncover the deeper, intended meaning of a long-gone author's texts.</p>
</p> 
<p>The TILT Web Application is powered by OpenAI's LLM to addresses sexist language in a direct and immediate way, by re-writing archaicly and unintentionally sexist writing into the gender-neutral norm that is expected by the readers of today.</p>
